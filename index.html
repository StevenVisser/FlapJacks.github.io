                <h1>Project Description</h1>
                A mobile web application that will allow a user to scan a physical object and produce a 3 Dimensional model that can be viewed from any direction. The user will also have the choice to build the model from cameras moving sub sections of video. The videos will consist of SFM clips. Once the model has been built, the user must be able to store both the stereo-lithography as well as the surface information (such as colouring). The user can select a stored model and generate a 3D render on a Web Page, where they will be able to rotate the model.

                I am a student at the university of Pretoria with the potential in fully coping with all materials in my field of Computer Science. I am an International student from Israel and that has enhanced my ability to adapt with different surroundings. To fully understand who I am, you will have to dive into what I want to become. I want to be in an environment where we can have multiple people with one mind, no conflicts, and maximum efficiency. To me this describes my very nature and thus radiates with me a unique personality that is beneficial for both my team and it's outcome.
